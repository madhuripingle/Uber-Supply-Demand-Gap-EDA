# Uber-Supply-Demand-Gap-EDA

## Project Summary -

Uber is an online car aggrigate service. Uber loses out on its revenue due to the supply and demand gap of the cars. This is mainly due to cancellation of requests by drivers and non-availability of cars. In this project, we will study, visualize and solve Uber's Supply Demand Gap Problem.
In Uber Dataset we have total 6745 record. All the trips are related to only Airport-City and City Airpots. Among that there are three types of Trips: 1.Trips completed 2.Cancelled 3.No cars available

The aim of analysis is to identify the root cause of Uber's problem (i.e.cancellation and non-availability of cars) and recommend ways to improve the situation. The approach for this project has been to divide the entire case study into various checkpoints to meet each of the sub-goals usind EDA and Visualization.

For this project, we will follow the following strategy:

1.Identify the problimatic trip status for trips originating from airport and city.</br>
2.Analyze if the day of week has any impact on the trips originating from airport and city for the problematic trip status. </br>
3.Determine the pressing problems by analyzing the request frequency of trips from airport and city for problematic trip statuses.</br>
4.Analyze the demand for cabs for each tieslot for trips from airport and city. </br>
5.Identify the timeslot that has the highest demand and supply gap, and find the request type (airport to city or city to airport) that is hugely effected. </br>
6.Identify the reasons for the gap. </br>
7.Recommend ways to resolve the gap.


## Business Objective
Identify patterns and trends in trip requests by time of day, day of the week, and pickup location. </br>
Detect peak demand hours and areas where the supply of drivers consistently fails to meet user demand. </br>
Analyze the reasons behind unfulfilled requests, such as high cancellation rates or no car availability. </br>
Generate actionable insights that can help Uber optimize driver distribution and improve customer satisfaction.
